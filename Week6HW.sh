Attempt 3
#!/bin/bash

#To read a file name, then awk command any lines where the first column contains a negative number greater than 10 and the second column contains a number less than 10, where cat will print to screen.
    echo "Enter a file name for part 6.3"
read fname
cat $fname | awk '{ if(($1>10) && ($2<10)){print}}'
exit
